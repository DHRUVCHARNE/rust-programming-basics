# Rust Programming Basics 🦀

This repository contains my code and learning work from the **Rust Programming Basics** course on **Cyfrin Updraft**.

The course provides a strong foundation in Rust, starting from the language fundamentals and progressing through Rust’s core concepts such as **ownership**, **borrowing**, **lifetimes**, **structs and enums**, **pattern matching**, **traits**, **generics**, **error handling**, and **async programming**.

The focus of this course is not just syntax, but understanding *why Rust works the way it does*—especially its memory-safety guarantees and compile-time checks. The code in this repository reflects hands-on exercises and examples that helped build a solid mental model of Rust.

This repository serves as a personal reference and a demonstration of my understanding of idiomatic Rust, suitable for systems programming, backend development, and blockchain-oriented use cases.
